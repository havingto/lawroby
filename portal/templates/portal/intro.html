Warm welcome!
<br><br>
I am LawRoby, your legal assistant. I will guide you through the 
labyrinth of thousands of pages of legislation to arrive at only 
those few sections and subsections which are directly and specifically 
relevant to your circumstances. 
<br/><br/>
Just like in a formal interview with a lawyer, I will ask you questions 
to identify the relevant facts and the main legal issue in your case. However, 
I will never ask personal information about you or about parties to 
your case. 
<br/><br/>
Presently I can assist you in Employment Law only, but soon I will 
also be able to help you in Family Law matters, 
and the work will continue...
<br/><br/>
At the conclusion of this interview, I will provide you with two 
downloadable pdf files: one will contain those 'snippets' of the relevant law 
(in the form of sections and subsections of the legislation) that 
are specific to your case, and another one that will outline the broader 
statutory framework of your case for context and reference.
<br/><br/>
However, you need to be aware that I cannot guarantee that at any point 
of time the information in those files is complete or exhaustive. Also, 
because I am not designed to interpret legislation or tell you what 
(or what not) to do, my assistance cannot replace professional legal advice, 
and in no circumstances should it be taken as such. 
(Yes, this was a disclaimerâ€¦)
