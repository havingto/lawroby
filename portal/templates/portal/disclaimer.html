At the conclusion of this interview, I will provide you with two 
downloadable pdf files: one will contain those 'snippets' of the relevant law 
(in the form of sections and subsections of the legislation) that 
are specific to your case, and another one that will outline the broader 
statutory framework of your case for context and reference.
<br/><br/>
However, you need to be aware that I cannot guarantee that at any point 
of time the information in those files is complete or exhaustive. Also, 
because I am not designed to interpret legislation or tell you what 
(or what not) to do, my assistance cannot replace professional legal advice, 
and in no circumstances should it be taken as such.
